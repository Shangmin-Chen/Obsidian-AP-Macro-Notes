What causes these shifts?

- Change in quantity of land/capital
- Change in the quality of the labor force (better educated or trained workers)
- Change in the available technology

What is the difference between a point below the curve and a shift to the left?
- Point below curve: resources are available but not used (ex. unemployment)
- Shift to the left: resources are NOT AVAILABLE (ex. natural disasters, military drafts)

Improvements/Declines in ONE rather than BOTH areas of production
- Constant/Linear: production of rice increases
