**Diminishing Income Utility**: Low-income → price increase → fewer consumers are able/willing to participate → quantity demand decreases

**Increasing Income Utility**: High-income → price decrease → more willing to buy → quantity increase 

**Causes of shift in DEMAND** - causes movement in [[supply curve]]
Change in income (increases in income tax → decrease in income → shift to left)
Change in population  (restricts immigration → shift to left)
Change in taste/preference
Change in expectations - snowstorm/covid

Change in **demand** means shift; change in **quantity demanded** MEANS movement along the curve NOT SHIFT
