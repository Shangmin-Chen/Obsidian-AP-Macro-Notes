PeD = % change in quantity demanded / % change in price

Percentage change = 100[(New - Old)/Old]

Slope of [[Demand Curve]] reflects elasticity (absolute values)

Elastic - something that has a lot of [[Substitutes]] (soft drinks, cereals, clothing, electronics, cars)

Inelastic - not substitutable (life-saving medicine, gas, electricity, cigarettes, post-secondary education)

Perfectly inelastic - ran out of resources
